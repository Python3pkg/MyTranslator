# MyTranslator
A simple tool for translating English and Chinese.

## How to install

```
pip install mytranslator
```

## How to use

Make sure you are working in your Python terminal and then
```
from mytranslator import *
```

And thus you can use the function `main()` to translate something you typed later.

## At last

This simple tool is just for pypi test, so it looks may not formatted. And there are something 'wrong' also.

I beg for your forgive. And if you have something to say, give me your issue is ok.

Thank you for your reading. Best wishes!
